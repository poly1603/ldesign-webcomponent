## ‚ú® New Features Added

### 1. **Image Filters** (`filter` prop)
Apply visual effects to images directly:
- `grayscale` - Black and white effect
- `sepia` - Vintage/retro effect  
- `blur` - Blur effect
- `brightness` - Increase brightness
- `contrast` - Enhance contrast
- `none` - No filter (default)

**Usage:**
```html
<ldesign-image src="photo.jpg" filter="grayscale" />
```

### 2. **Watermark Support** (`watermark` prop)
Add text watermarks with customizable positioning:
- Positions: `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right`, `center`
- Semi-transparent overlay with backdrop blur
- Ideal for copyright protection

**Usage:**
```html
<ldesign-image 
  src="artwork.jpg" 
  watermark="¬© 2024 Your Brand"
  watermark-position="bottom-right"
/>
```

### 3. **Image Comparison Slider** (`comparison` prop)
Interactive before/after comparison with draggable slider:
- Smooth drag interaction
- Touch and mouse support
- Perfect for showing improvements, edits, or A/B comparisons

**Usage:**
```html
<ldesign-image 
  src="before.jpg"
  comparison-src="after.jpg"
  comparison
/>
```

### 4. **Touch Gesture Support**
Enhanced mobile experience with:
- **Pinch-to-zoom**: Two-finger zoom in preview mode
- **Smooth touch interactions**: Better responsiveness on mobile devices
- **Touch-optimized controls**: Larger touch targets

### 5. **Fetch Priority Control** (`fetchpriority` prop)
Fine-tune loading priority for better performance:
- `high` - Critical above-the-fold images
- `low` - Below-the-fold images
- `auto` - Browser decides (default)

**Usage:**
```html
<!-- Hero image: load with high priority -->
<ldesign-image 
  src="hero.jpg" 
  lazy="false"
  fetchpriority="high"
/>
```
